# 🏛️ ECLIPSE - A Smart Museum Management App

**ECLIPSE** is a digital solution designed to modernize and streamline the management and visitor experience of museums. In this age of digitalization, it's only fitting that museums also embrace technology to improve operations and enhance engagement.

## ✨ Project Overview

Museums are regaining popularity, especially among younger generations. However, traditional museum visits often come with challenges like:

- Overcrowding at peak hours
- Long queues at entry and food counters
- Time restrictions and poor slot management
- Inconvenient payment modes
- Lack of engagement or pre-information

**ECLIPSE** addresses all of these issues by providing a user-friendly mobile app interface that simplifies and enhances the museum experience for both visitors and administrators.
